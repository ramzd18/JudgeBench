You were previously given an instruction and a sample response. Your task is to generate feedback highlighting what the response does well and what it does poorly, focusing on how effectively it addresses the original instruction.

# Instruction:
{{question}}

# Response:
{{response}}

Generate detailed feedback for this response. Evaluate both its strengths and weaknesses, particularly how well it addresses the user's instruction. 
Return only a dictionary with a key called "feedback" mapping to a string containing your feedback, formatted exactly like this:
{"feedback": "your feedback here"}
Do not include any other text or explanation - just the dictionary.
